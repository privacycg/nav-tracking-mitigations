# Navigation-based Tracking Mitigations

Work in this repository analyzes the problem of navigation-based cross-site
tracking and seeks to change browser behavior in order to prevent it. See the
**[Navigational-Tracking Mitigations
specification](https://privacycg.github.io/nav-tracking-mitigations/)** for more
details.

The [bounce tracking mitigations explainer](bounce-tracking-explainer.md)
outlines a proposal for aligning browsers on a common mitigation for bounce
tracking.

This is a [Work Item](https://privacycg.github.io/charter.html#work-items) of
the [Privacy Community Group](https://privacycg.github.io/). It originated out
of [proposal 6](https://github.com/privacycg/proposals/issues/6) of the [Privacy
Community Group](https://privacycg.github.io/), but this work focuses more
broadly on all navigation-based tracking mechanisms.
