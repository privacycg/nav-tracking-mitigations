Some browsers have deployed and announced protections against
navigational tracking. This section is a work in progress to detail what
protections have been shipped and / or are planned. This section is not
comprehensive.

<h3 id="mitigations-safari">Safari</h3>
Safari uses an algorithmic approach to combat navigational tracking. Safari
labels a site as having navigational-based cross-site tracking capability if
the following criteria are met within a particular client:

* The site automatically redirects the user to other sites, immediately
    or after a short delay.
* The site has not received a user activation.

Sites can be "tainted" as having cross-site tracking capabilities if they
redirect to sites already classified as having cross-site tracking capabilities.
For example, consider the case of a user clicking on a link on
`start.example`, which redirects to `second.example`,
which redirects to `third.example`, which redirects to
`end.example`. If Safari has classified `third.example` as
having tracking capabilities, the above behavior can result in Safari classifying
`second.example` as having cross-site tracking capabilities.

If the [=host/registrable domain=] that the user is being automatically
redirected *from* has been classified as having cross-site tracking
capabilities, Safari will delete all non-cookie storage on the site
the user is being redirected *to*, if the user does not interact (i.e., register
a user activation) on the destination site within seven days of browser use.

Additionally, if the URL the user is navigating *to* has either query parameters
or a URL fragment, the lifetime of client-side set cookies on
the *destination* page is capped at 24 hours.


<h3 id="mitigations-firefox">Firefox</h3>
Firefox uses a list-based approach to combat navigational tracking. Sites on the
Disconnect list are considered tracking sites. All storage
for tracking sites is cleared after 24 hours, unless the user has interacted
with the site in the first-party context in the last 45 days.

<h3 id="mitigations-brave">Brave</h3>
Brave uses three list-based approaches to combat navigational tracking.

First, Brave strips query parameters commonly used for navigational tracking
from URLs on navigation. This list is maintained by Brave.

Second, in the non-default, "aggressive blocking" configuration, Brave uses
popular crowd-sourced filter lists (e.g., EasyList, EasyPrivacy, uBlock Origin)
to identify URLs that are used for bounce tracking, and will preempt the
navigation with an interstitial (similar to Google SafeBrowsing), giving
the user the option to continue the navigation or cancel it.

Third, Brave uses a list-based approach for identifying bounce tracking
URLs where the destination URL is present in the URL of the intermediate
tracking URL. In such cases, Brave will skip the intermediate navigation
and request the destination URL instead. For example, if Brave
Browser observes the user about to navigate to the URL
`https://tracker.example/bounce?dest=https://destination.example/`,
the browser may replace the navigation to `tracker.example/bounce`,
with a navigation to `https://destination.example/`. This list
is maintained by Brave, and is drawn from a mix of crowd-sourcing and
existing open-source projects.
